## Visualizing Changes in Labor Market Outcomes for Women in the United States
This document identifies trends in labor market outcomes for women in the United States using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) from 1980 to 2020. The purpose of these visualizations is to identify potential changes in employment and labor market participation that could be explained by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with further research.
Data files and the data dictionary for the CPS can be found [at this link](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/about.shtml).
### Data Cleaning and Setting Up
```{r setup, include = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = FALSE)
library(srvyr)
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
def.chunk.hook  <- knitr::knit_hooks$get("chunk")
knitr::knit_hooks$set(chunk = function(x, options) {
x <- def.chunk.hook(x, options)
ifelse(options$size != "normalsize", paste0("\n \\", options$size,"\n\n", x, "\n\n \\normalsize"), x)
})
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Data Cleaning and Processing

## **Figure 1: Female Employment Rate (1980 - 2020)**
Figure 1 shows the change in female employment rates in the United States from 1980 to 2020 at the start of each decade. From 1980 to 2000, female employment rate increased from X to X. The employment rate fell sharply by 2010 to X and continued to decline to X by 2020. Further analysis could explore whether these drops in employment among women are related to specific shocks, such as the 2008 real estate crisis or the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in late 2019.
