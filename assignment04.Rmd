## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
library("ipumsr")
library("tidyverse")
library("dplyr")
ddi <- read_ipums_ddi("cps_00002.xml")
data <- read_ipums_micro(ddi)
data1 <- data %>% 
  drop_na(WTFINL)
library(srvyr)
cps_svy <- as_survey_design(data1, weights = WTFINL)
class(cps_svy)
class(data)

#Visualization 1: Female and Employment Rate From 1980 Onwards
library("ggplot2")
library("haven")
cps_svy %>% 
  mutate(female = if_else(SEX == 2, 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(employed = if_else(EMPSTAT == 10 | EMPSTAT == 12, 1, 0)) %>%
  mutate(unemployed = if_else(EMPSTAT == 10 | EMPSTAT == 12, 0, 1)) %>%
  filter (female == 1,  AGE >= 16) %>% 
  group_by(YEAR) %>% 
  summarize(
    employed = survey_mean(employed == 1)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = YEAR, y = employed)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(
    title = "Female Employment Rate 1980-2020 Upon Each Decade", 
    subtitle = "Female employment rate peaked in 2000 and has decreased since", 
    x = "Year", 
    y = "Female Employment Rate", 
    caption = "Source = Integrated Public Use Microdata Series by Minnesota Population Center"
  )
  
 
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
